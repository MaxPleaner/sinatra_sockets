# Requires all ruby files in this directory.
# Orders them by the count of "/" in their filename.
# Therefore, shallower files are loaded first.
# The reasoning for this is to support the common convention of naming
# files according to their contained class hierarchies.
# i.e. class Foo would be in foo.rb,
#      class Foo::Bar would be in foo/bar.rb,
#
# If there is the situation where a class depends on another that is in a 
# deeper-nested file, there's always the option to pass the dependency at
# runtime.

# The REST routes (listed in this file) cannot store information in the session
# since it's on another host.
# Rather, they pass back and forth a token identifier
#
# This is the :token param, and is required on all routes except for
# /token
#
# Here's an outline of the flow:
#
# 1. Client hits GET /token, gets a new token
# 2. Client sends token with websocket connection request at GET /ws
# 3. Client hits GET /authenticate and goes through Github oAuth login
# 4. Github sends callback to server, which sends the OK to client over websocket

# In leue of sessions, three global objects are used:
#   Users: <Hash> with keys: <username> and vals: <Set(token)>
#   AuthenticatedTokens: <hash> with keys: <token> and vals: <username>
#   Sockets: <hash> with keys: <token> and vals: <socket>

Sockets = {}
AuthenticatedTokens = {}
Users = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = Set.new }
